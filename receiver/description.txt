Interesting Facts API

This is an application for a random facts service that allows curious and entertainment-seeking to view and subscribe for interesting facts.

The events are fact adding requests and facts subscription requests:

- The fact addition requests events are expected to be very high in the afternoon from Friday to Sunday as this is the time when people have the most free time.
- The subscription requests are expected to be high on Mondays when people are feeling the most bored and want excitement or entertainment.

The requests are stored to allow the following:

- analysis of how many users subscribe per day
- analysis of whether or not the user liked the interesting fact
- aggregation of data across users to find which categories are most popular

Users of the system are fact-enthusiasts and service admins
